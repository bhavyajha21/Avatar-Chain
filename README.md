# Avatar Chain

## Project Description

Avatar Chain is a revolutionary decentralized avatar management system built on blockchain technology. It allows users to create, customize, and manage unique digital avatars that are stored immutably on the blockchain. Each avatar is represented as a unique digital asset with customizable attributes, levels, and ownership that can be transferred between users.

The platform leverages IPFS for decentralized storage of avatar images and metadata, ensuring that avatar data remains accessible and censorship-resistant. Users can create personalized avatars, level them up through various activities, add custom attributes, and even transfer ownership to other users in a trustless manner.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a unified, interoperable avatar ecosystem where digital identities transcend individual platforms and applications. Avatar Chain aims to:

- **Democratize Digital Identity**: Enable users to truly own their digital avatars without dependency on centralized platforms
- **Foster Interoperability**: Create avatars that can be used across multiple games, metaverses, and applications
- **Build Trust**: Use blockchain technology to ensure transparent, verifiable avatar ownership and history
- **Encourage Creativity**: Provide a platform where users can express themselves through customizable digital personas
- **Enable Value Creation**: Allow avatars to accumulate value through levels, achievements, and unique attributes

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16 or higher
- Hardhat development environment
- Web3 wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- IPFS node or Pinata account for image storage

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/avatar-chain.git
cd avatar-chain

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to local network

```

### Usage Example
```javascript
// Create a new avatar
const tx = await avatarContract.createAvatar(
    "My Awesome Avatar",
    "QmXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxX", // IPFS hash
    ["Warrior", "Level 1", "Strength: 100"]
);

// Level up avatar
await avatarContract.updateAvatar(
    1, // avatar ID
    "", // keep current name
    "", // keep current image
    5,  // increase level by 5
    ["New Skill: Magic", "Achievement: First Victory"]
);
```
